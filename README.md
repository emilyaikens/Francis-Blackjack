## Welcome to Blackjack!

The rules to Blackjack are fairly straightforward. Your objective is to get as close to 21 as possible. All face cards are worth 10, and Aces are worth either 11 or 1.

#### The Interface

The buttons will be clearly labeled, here's what each of them do.

You can click the plus or minus button to adjust your bet, and once you have decided on an amount, click the middle green button to add that amount to your current betting pool.

![All In Button](/assets/readme-info/all-in.png)

Alternatively, you could go ahead and go all in to put all your chips into the betting pool.

![Clear Bet Button](/assets/readme-info/clear-bet.png)

Your bet isn't final until you deal. You can always take the pool back with the clear bet button. Otherwise, hit deal!

![Hit Stand Double Buttons](/assets/readme-info/hit-stay-double.png)

Hit means you ask the dealer to deal you the next card. Stand means your turn ends, and then dealer will keep drawing cards until they hit 17 or higher. If they go over 21, you win! But if they're closer than you to 21, you will lose. Otherwise, if you tie, it is called a push, and you get your bet back.
